- Additionally X and Y axis movement through-out galaxy.
- Added pinch zooming from current point of reference using gyro angle through z axis.
- Collected data from NASA Exoplanets archieve under HWO exoplanets.
- Created a virtual environment to display HWO exoplanets across the 3D plane of view and learn each stars details.
- Galactic Circle (Huge circular net) is build as a frame of reference for all the stars.
- Each star revolves around the galactic circle.
- Each star can be clicked to get its detailed info.

## Code Execution Instruction:
